      1. APPLICABILITY

1.1 The terms and conditions (hereafter called: conditions) are applicable on all offers, orders and agreements from FentinoFabrics.

1.2 Accepting an offer or placing an order implies that you accept the applicability of these conditions.

1.3 Deviations from these conditions are only respected when FentinoFabrics has agreed upon these deviations in writing.

1.4 All other terms of these conditions will remain effective should one or more of the terms be nullified and/or be made invalid. By mutual arrangement, FentinoFabrics and the client will then form new terms to replace those nullified and/or made invalid, as much as possible following the implied purpose of the term(s) in question.

1.5 These conditions respect consumer rights as stipulated by law from the sales agreement.

2. OFFERS AND AGREEMENTS

2.1 We reserve the right to modify prices, especially when necessary because of legal constraints. All offers are on a basis of availability.

2.2 An agreement is only made after the acceptance of your order by FentinoFabrics after the order form on the FentinoFabrics online store has been filled out correctly. An agreement is in place when we send a confirmation of the order to the buyer.

2.3 We are entitled to refuse orders, or impose certain conditions on them unless expressly stated otherwise.

2.4 We will notify a buyer within ten (10) days after receipt of the order should that order be refused.

2.5 We are not obliged to deliver products that are out of stock when orders for the product are made until the product has been produced and is in stock.

2.6 FentinoFabrics has made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours of our products that appear on the website. However, slight differences may occur due to resolution as computer monitors vary and have different colour calibrations.

2.7 The buyer and we agree that a valid agreement is in place through electronic communication, once these conditions have been followed and the order procedure has been completed.

2.8 The following information will be stated in the order confirmation: A description of the product the customer has purchased, the product number, size, colour and quantity of the product purchased. Price of the product in Indian Rupee Notes(INR). Shipment and handling fees that result from the agreement we made with the customer. Customer details, such as name, invoice or delivery address, e-mail address and customer phone or fax number. The order number of the agreement. The e-mail address of Lorem Classic the customer should use for questions regarding the order.

3. PRICES AND PAYMENTS

3.1 All quoted prices are in Indian Rupee Notes(INR), include VAT and exclude shipment and handling fees, other taxes, and charges unless specified otherwise or agreed upon in writing. All prices are subject to change.

3.2 Payment without discounts or compensation is due within fourteen (14) days after the invoice date unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.

3.3 Reimbursement: If you have already made the payment when the agreement with we cancelled in accordance with the cooling-off conditions (referring to â€˜terms and conditions), FentinoFabrics will reimburse the customer for the payments already received within 14 days after receipt of the returned product.

4. DELIVERY / DELIVERY TIME

4.1 The delivery time of any product may be up to 30 days or as much shorter as possible. All delivery times specified by FentinoFabrics are of an indicative nature only.

4.2 Exceeding the delivery time does not give any rights for compensation by FentinoFabrics or order cancellation.

4.3 When the customer has already made payments as per the agreement that will be annulled in accordance with article 4.2, FentinoFabrics will return the sum already paid within 14 business days after receipt of the annulment specified in article 4.2.

4.4 Delivery of the products will take place at the location and time when the products are ready to be delivered to the customer.

5. Colour Variation/Wear & Tear

5.1 Leather: Reproduction of colours is as accurate as possible, although please note, colours available at the stores may vary slightly from what is displayed on your monitor. Also, leather is a natural material and a slight variation is bound to appear in each item.

5.2 Fabric: Some products have digital printing on fabric on which slight variation might occur in different parts or patches. This is a general property of the fabric which cannot be controlled.

5.3 Hardware Colour: Some of the products with metal hardware might tarnish or lose their shine over time due to weather conditions and usage. These are changes that occur due to the varied use and handling of the product by the customer and cannot be held against the manufacturers.

5.4 Defects and Scratches: All Lorem Classic products are handcrafted, hence no two products are identical in their absolute measurements. There might be a slight change, but minimal to the eye which therefore would not change the essence of the design.

5.5 Scratches and Marks: Scratches and marks on the leather surface are a part of the characteristics of the material. They do not qualify as defects. This can happen due to use over a period of time which enhances the look and feel of the product, adding to its vintage appeal. Some types of leather might have a slight patina on the surface due to usage and are the quality of the leather. Products are only designed to see and keep in mind all the above-mentioned factors. Marks are common on leather as each skin is different to the other, as no two skins are the same. Please note, these are NOT considered defects or rejects.
